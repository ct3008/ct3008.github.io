			Artistic Vision
		</div>
		<p>
			The motivation behind this project was to subvert the stereotypical desire for love and 
			affection on Valentines Day. Instead of sending a card to spread love, I decided to send 
			a card to remind people that romance is hard and to put loving their well-being first. 
			As such, this “anti”-Valentine's card TTGO display came about. I also made it so that 
			after the text story is done, the device will go to sleep for a while to really hit home 
			the point of focusing on sleep. I, as a CS major, am well aware of the horrible sleep habits 
			myself and many of those around me indulge in. So, in my sleep-deprived ridden state, I decided 
			to have both words and actions of my art try to convince anyone watching to take the first step 
			towards a healthy lifestyle. This attribute mainly came about due to battery life concerns, but 
			I decided to incorporate a timed screen-off section into the artistic vision. 
		</p>
		<p>
			To start off, I just created this text image using an online source for keyboard text emojis that 
			looked sleepy and made sure that I could get it to appear on the screen.
		</p>

		<p>
			After this, I wanted to make a cute story relating to Valentine’s, which somehow evolved to a bit 
			of an anti-Valentine’s message and a PSA to get more sleep. To add more some aspects of randomness, 
			I started by incorporating a random function within the point where the boy runs away so that he’d 
			be placed in random places along the screen until he finally leaves the screen.
		</p>
		<p>The first draft with my artistic story vision. Has a failed love story with a boy running from a confession and a PSA to sleep afterwards. All positions are hard-coded at this point.</p>

		<p>
			After this, I also wanted to implement another random function where phrases and emojis would appear at random locations on the screen 
			and would be randomly chosen from an array of options. A text color is also randomly chosen per function call.

		<p>
			I attempted to implement wifi connection in order to be able to dynamically draw images or gifs from the internet, but was running into 
			a lot of issues and had to scrap the idea. There was a definite misconnection between the server and the client as none of the messages 
			being received by the Serial Monitor were coherent. This resulted in an incomprehensible image on the ESP32 screen.

			It includes multiple random functions and sleeps for 7 minutes after the 1.5 minutes of being online. The space is Milstein 5 which has 
			been my study area of choice since sophomore year. It is very clinical looking and gives me extreme PTSD from the many sleepless nights 
			spent coding there, so with this installation, I really wanted to utilize the technology as a reminder to not do that and to get some 
			quality rest - redefining the space in my mind.
